    "This notebook showcases how to use conversable agents in AutoGen to realize a Society of Mind (SoM) scenario, in which an agent runs a  chat session with another agent as an inner-monologue. The idea of SoM and part of the example demonstrated in this notebook come from this PR: https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/pull/890\n",

      "5. Compare the stock's performance with its sector or industry to determine if the movement is company-specific or part of a larger trend.\n",
