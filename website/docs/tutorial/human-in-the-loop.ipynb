    "\n",

    "class supports a human-in-the-loop component.\n",
    "In this chapter, we will show how you can use this component to both allow human \n",

    "\n",
    "By default, the human-in-the-loop component considers two conditions for deciding whether to terminate a conversation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. _Message-based_: This condition triggers termination if the content of a message contains\n",
    "    the word \"TERMINATE\". You can customize this condition\n",
    "    using the `is_terminate_msg` argument in the constructor of the `ConversableAgent` class.\n",
    "2. _Counter-based_: This condition trigger termination if the number of automatic responses to the same sender\n",
    "    exceeds a threshold. You can customize this using the `max_consecutive_auto_reply` argument of the\n",
    "    `ConversableAgent` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that when a termination condition is triggered,\n",
    "the conversation is not always terminated immediately. The actual termination\n",

    "    intercept, or terminate the conversation; message-based termination\n",
    "    condition is still enacted upon if human chooses to skip; counter-based\n",
    "    termination condition is ignored.\n",
    "3. `TERMINATE`: human input is only requested when a termination condition is\n",
    "    met -- this is the default mode; if the human chooses to skip, automatic\n",
    "    reply components are used; \n",
    "    if the human chooses to intercept and reply, the conversation continues\n",
    "    and the counter is reset; if the human chooses to terminate, the conversation\n",
